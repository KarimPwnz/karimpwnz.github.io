## Hobby Projects

### [sourcegraph-scripts](https://github.com/KarimPwnz/sourcegraph-scripts) (2022)

A set of **Python** scripts to identify vulnerabilities in GitHub projects using **Sourcegraph**. The scripts download code files from Sourcegraph results; subsequently, static analysis is applied to identify vulnerabilities en masse. This demonstrates a unique use-case of Sourcegraph for security research.

**Tech stack:** *Python, Bash, Semgrep, Git*

### [dns-exfil](https://github.com/KarimPwnz/dns-exfil) (2021)

A **Python** tool to start a DNS server for exfilitration or ping-back detection. The tool supports hex encoding and outputs JSON, allowing easy parsing with something like jq. The project has been successfully used to detect the Log4Shell vulnerability.

**Tech stack:** *Python, DNS, Git*

### [censorship-detector](https://github.com/KarimPwnz/censorship-detector) (2021)

A browser extension (in **JavaScript**) that identifies website censorship techniques. Although experimental, it can recognize DNS, HTTP, SNI filtering—all from a browser extension. I built the extension to tackle censorship of sites in Lebanon, my home country.

**Tech stack:** *JavaScript, HTML, CSS, npm, Webpack, WebExtensions API, Git*
